        I am Andranik, a software engineer based in Yerevan, Armenia, with nearly two decades of programming experience.
        My background is in computer science, and I am deeply interested in programming languages. I've learned some Czech
        during my studies abroad and speak Armenian, English, and Russian.

        Most of my industry work is in fintech, although I've also worked in education and travel domains. Projects spanned
        a variety of tools and languages, and I am now closer to /usually/ typed languages on VMs than the system\hardware.
        Paired with my opinions on programming languages, that made me better with Scala over, say, Rust, or Python over Go
        /I never got to use an ML language in production
        ðŸ˜”/.

        Through trial and error and personal experience, management-wise, I lean towards frequent demos over estimating,
        pairing over reviews, and managing features over patches. I've noticed that better work is being produced when
        working in such a fashion.

        In my spare time, I've helped set up learning courses technically /GitHub and Google classrooms, infrastructure,
        etc./ and content-wise. Every now and then, I'd work on a pet project in a language I was obsessed with at the
        time /Clojure at the moment/, and once I tried my hand at <a href="https://github.com/haniravi/nito">hardware</a>.
        On a random note, I've won the only <a
          href="https://www.seasidestartupsummit.com/blog/nairi-insurance-is-the-first-sponsor-of-the-firecode-marathon">hackathon</a>
        &nbsp;I ever participated in.

        Generally, I'm interested in programming languages and their ways of describing systems, and lately, dynamic ones,
        particularly Lisps, have caught my attention, which spilled into a <a href="https://github.com/amuradyan/sea">toy
          Lisp implementation</a> to experiment with. I'm interested in building systems with dynamic languages to see
        whether a tight enough test net can take over the type system responsibilities, including the semantics of the
        latter that aids local reasoning.

        In my early years of studying I was interested in cryptography and information theory, which I still find fascinating.
        During my PhD years in Charles University in Prague, I took courses in modern programming languages, embedded systems,
        and system behavior models and verification, but my research was about formal expression and verification /DSL/ of
        component-based systems.
